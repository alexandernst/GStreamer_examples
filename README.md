GStreamer examples
==================

This project aims to show how to do some things with GStreamer.
If you have seen all those one-liners living in Google and you
have been wondering how to "convert" them to C code, then this
is the thing you're looking for.

I'll do my best to cover as many examples as I'm able, for both
0.10 and 1.0 versions of GStreamer.

Also, I'll accept any patches that are sent (good looking and good
working patches, that is).

The licence is WTFPL, so do whatever you want with this code.
